📌 Project Overview

Customer support teams face high query volumes (50,000+ queries/day) across multiple channels—email, chat, voice, and social media. This project proposes an AI Case Resolution Agent to automate classification, resolution, and escalation while maintaining compliance and customer satisfaction.

🏗 System Architecture

Multi-channel Data Ingestion
Collect queries from email, chatbots, voice transcripts, and social media in near real-time.

Classification Pipeline
Use machine learning and LLMs to analyze priority, intent, sentiment, and compliance risks.

Resolution Engine
Automate solutions when confidence is high, otherwise escalate to human agents.

Supervisor Dashboard
Monitor SLA adherence, AI-human workload split, compliance alerts, and performance metrics.

Feedback & Retraining
Capture resolution feedback to improve models continuously.

🔄 Workflow

Ingestion: Queries flow into the pipeline.

Preprocessing: Noise reduction, metadata tagging.

Classification: Prioritization, sentiment analysis, intent detection.

Resolution Path:

Auto-resolution when confidence > threshold.

Escalation when complex or non-compliant.

Supervisor Oversight: Dashboard for monitoring.

Feedback Loop: Retrain AI for improved accuracy.

📊 Scaling Strategy

Built to handle 50,000+ queries/day.

Uses asynchronous pipelines, load balancers, and distributed processing.

Audit logging ensures tamper-proof compliance records.
